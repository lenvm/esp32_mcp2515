mcp_2515
==========

This library implements a driver for the MCP2515 SPI CAN module, to be used with an ESP32.

These files were originally present on the `can_common` repository https://github.com/collin80/can_common, but removed as of commit e1799212.

This library requires the `can_common` library. That library is a common base that 
other libraries can be built off of to allow a more universal API for CAN. The can_common library is found here: https://github.com/collin80/can_common.
